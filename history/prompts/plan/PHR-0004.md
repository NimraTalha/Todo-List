## Prompt Text

We are in phase2-web according to .spec-kit/config.yaml

Create a comprehensive, detailed implementation plan for COMPLETING THE ENTIRE NEXT.JS FRONTEND ONLY.

Do not include any backend, FastAPI, database, or Neon-related tasks in this plan. Focus exclusively on the frontend.

The plan must be based strictly on these specifications:
- @specs/overview.md
- @specs/features/task-crud.md
- @specs/features/authentication.md
- @specs/api/rest-endpoints.md
- frontend/CLAUDE.md guidelines

Plan Goals:
- Build a fully functional, responsive, secure Todo web app frontend
- Integrate Better Auth with JWT tokens
- Consume the exact REST API endpoints defined in specs
- Follow all Next.js 16+ App Router and Tailwind best practices
- Use server components by default
- Prepare for seamless backend connection later

The plan should include:

1. High-level phases (e.g., Setup → Auth → Core UI → Polish)
2. Detailed steps within each phase
3. File structure decisions and key files to create
4. Component hierarc dont change thee existing plan.md file just update it
