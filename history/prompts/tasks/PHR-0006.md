## Prompt Text

We are in phase2-web and focusing ONLY on completing the Next.js frontend.

Break down the complete frontend implementation into clear, sequential, manageable subtasks according to Spec-Kit specs and best practices.

Consider these specs:
- @specs/features/task-crud.md
- @specs/features/authentication.md
- @specs/api/rest-endpoints.md
- frontend/CLAUDE.md guidelines

The breakdown should cover everything needed for a fully functional, responsive Todo frontend including:
- Better Auth setup with JWT
- Login/Signup pages
- Protected routing
- Task dashboard with list, filters, CRUD forms
- Centralized API client with JWT attachment
- Responsive Tailwind UI
- Proper component structure
- Layout and navigation

Organize tasks logically (e.g., setup → auth → API client → UI components → pages → polish).

Number each task clearly.
For each task, include:
- Task title
- Description
- Relevant spec references
- Files to create/modify
- Dependencies (if any)

Prioritize tasks so we can implement s
