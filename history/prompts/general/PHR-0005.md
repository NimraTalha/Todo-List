## Prompt Text

Focus exclusively on completing the Next.js frontend for Phase II of the hackathon-todo project.

Implement the full, responsive, production-ready frontend according to these exact specifications:

- @specs/overview.md
- @specs/features/task-crud.md
- @specs/features/authentication.md
- @specs/api/rest-endpoints.md (frontend must consume these exact endpoints)
- Strictly follow all guidelines in frontend/CLAUDE.md

Current goal: Complete the entire /frontend directory only. Do not create or modify any backend files, routes, models, or database code.

Required Frontend Features:

1. Better Auth Integration
- Configure Better Auth with JWT plugin enabled
- Login page: /app/login/page.tsx
- Signup page: /app/signup/page.tsx
- On successful auth → receive JWT token and redirect to /tasks
- Protected routes (redirect unauthenticated users to /login)

2. Todo Dashboard
- Protected route: /app/tasks/page.tsx
- Fetch and display tasks from API
- Show: checkbox (toggle complete), title (strikethrough when completed), description, created date
- Filter options: All / Pending / Completed
- "Add New Task" button

3. Task Forms
- Create task form (modal or separate route)
- Edit task form (modal or dynamic route)
- Title (required), Description (optional)
- Client-side validation

4. API Client
- Create frontend/lib/api.ts
- Base URL: http://localhost:8000
- Automatically attach JWT from Better Auth in Authorization: Bearer header
- Typed functions for all CRUD operations matching the spec

5. Layout & Navigation
- Root layout with responsive navbar
- Show logged-in user email + Logout button
- Clean, modern Tailwind design throughout

6. Styling & Patterns
- Tailwind CSS only (no inline styles)
- Mobile-first responsive
- Server components by default
- Client components only for interactivity
- Loading states and error handling

Use existing agents and skills:
- ui-builder-agent
- responsive-todo-ui skill
- task-crud-operations skill

Create all necessary files in /frontend:
- app/layout.tsx, app/page.tsx
